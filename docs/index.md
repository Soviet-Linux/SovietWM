**Please note:** I probably wont update this much so dont use it as your main wm

## Description

SovietWM is an extremely crappy window manager that I developed out of boredom using the [Penrose Window Manager library](https://github.com/sminez/penrose).



## Installation

Please see the [docs](https://theholytachanka.github.io/SovietWM/INSTALL.md) to build it from source.

## Customisation

To configure and customise SWM please see the [docs](https://theholytachanka.github.io/SovietWM/configure.md).
